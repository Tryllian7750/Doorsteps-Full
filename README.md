# Doorsteps-Full


To run and bulld the project just run "dotnet run"
then goto either http://localhost:5000 or https://localhost:5001

Decided to build this in dotnet as I have not been using for many years wow has it change or maybe I have lol 

Things that need to be done add some security to api and corrs support and a little more error checking.
